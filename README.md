# deploy-ngadmin-workshop

Once in the folder with our brand new app we can launch
deployd runing `dpd`

```bash
$ dpd
```

Now you can check [`localhost:2403`](http://localhost:2403) and you
should see a welcome page. Also, you can check
[`localhost:2403/dashboard`](http://localhost:2403/dashboard) and the
deployd dashboard will show up.
